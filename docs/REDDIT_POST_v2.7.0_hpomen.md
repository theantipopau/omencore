# OmenCore 2.7.0 - A Complete OMEN Gaming Hub Replacement (No HP Software Required)

Hey everyone! Wanted to share **OmenCore**, a free, open-source control center I've been developing for HP OMEN and Victus laptops.

---

## What is OmenCore?

OmenCore is a **complete replacement for HP OMEN Gaming Hub**. It's a single ~70MB executable that gives you full control over your laptop without any HP bloatware, telemetry, or Microsoft account requirements.

**Key differences from OMEN Gaming Hub:**
- âœ… Works without OGH installed - uses native WMI BIOS commands
- âœ… No ads, no telemetry, no sign-in
- âœ… Runs on Windows AND Linux
- âœ… Open source (MIT license)
