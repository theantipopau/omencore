## 🐛 Bug Fixes

---

### Fix A — XAML Startup Crash (`StaticResourceExtension` threw an exception)

**Severity:** High — crashes on startup; affects all users on v3.0.0 / hotfix1

**Symptom:** `System.Windows.Markup.XamlParseException: Provide value on 'System.Windows.StaticResourceExtension' threw an exception` on app start. The main window would fail to load.

**Root Cause:** Five resource keys were referenced in XAML views but were never defined in `ModernStyles.xaml` or any merged dictionary. WPF performs strict StaticResource/DynamicResource lookups at load time; any undefined key throws immediately.

**Missing Keys Found:**

| Key | Location | Type |
|---|---|---|
| `SliderValueToWidthConverter` | `TuningView.xaml` (dead `TuningSlider` style) | `StaticResource` |
| `BackgroundBrush` | `OnboardingWindow.xaml` (×2) | `StaticResource` |
| `SurfaceBrush` | `OnboardingWindow.xaml` (title bar) | `StaticResource` |
| `InvertBool` | `SystemControlView.xaml` (×4) | `StaticResource` |
| `InfoBackgroundBrush` | `DiagnosticExportControl.xaml` | `DynamicResource` |

**Fixes Applied:**

- **`TuningView.xaml`** — Removed the entire dead `TuningSlider` style (82 lines) which referenced the non-existent `SliderValueToWidthConverter`. The style had zero usages across the entire codebase and was never applied.
- **`OnboardingWindow.xaml`** — `BackgroundBrush` → `BackgroundDarkBrush`; `SurfaceBrush` → `SurfaceMediumBrush` (correct equivalents already defined in `ModernStyles.xaml`).
- **`SystemControlView.xaml`** — All four occurrences of `InvertBool` → `InverseBooleanConverter` (the actual registered converter key).
- **`ModernStyles.xaml`** — Added missing `InfoBackgroundBrush` (`Color="#1A2196F3"`) adjacent to the existing `WarningBackgroundBrush` entry.

### Fix B — Secure Boot Status Displayed Inverted (shows "Disabled" when Enabled)

**Severity:** Medium — incorrect status display in Settings; does not affect functionality

**Symptom:** On systems where PawnIO is installed and Secure Boot is enabled, the "System Status" section in Settings showed a green "Disabled" badge for Secure Boot. Log correctly reported `Secure Boot: Enabled`, confirming the display was wrong.

**Root Cause:** `SettingsViewModel.LoadSystemStatus()` contained:

```csharp
SecureBootEnabled = rawSecureBoot && !PawnIOAvailable;
```

The intent was: "only flag Secure Boot as a restriction if PawnIO is unavailable." But this made the property semantically incorrect — `SecureBootEnabled` no longer reflected the hardware truth. On any system with PawnIO installed, `!PawnIOAvailable = false`, so `SecureBootEnabled` would always be `false` regardless of the actual hardware state.

**Fix:**

```csharp
// Before
SecureBootEnabled = rawSecureBoot && !PawnIOAvailable;

// After — always reflects the hardware state
SecureBootEnabled = rawSecureBoot;
```

The description text in `SettingsView.xaml` was also updated to reflect that PawnIO provides compatible driver access even with Secure Boot enabled, so users with both active see an informative (not alarming) message.

### Fix C — Ctrl+Shift+O Global Hotkey Dead After Window Deactivation (Issue #70)

**Severity:** High — the primary keyboard shortcut to open OmenCore from the tray is non-functional; users must click the tray icon instead

**Symptom:** Pressing Ctrl+Shift+O after the OmenCore window loses focus or is hidden to the tray does nothing. The hotkey worked in v2.x but broke in v3.0.0.

**Root Cause:** v3.0.0 introduced `WindowFocusedHotkeys` mode (default: `true`) to avoid hotkey conflicts with games and editors. When the main window is deactivated, the app called `UnregisterAllHotkeys()` — which unregistered **every** hotkey including `ToggleWindow` (Ctrl+Shift+O). Since `ToggleWindow` is the mechanism to *bring the window back*, unregistering it made it impossible to reopen the app via keyboard.

**Fix:**

1. **`HotkeyService.cs`** — Added `UnregisterAllExcept(HotkeyAction preserveAction)` method which unregisters all Win32 hotkeys except the specified action, keeping its global registration alive:

   ```csharp
   public void UnregisterAllExcept(HotkeyAction preserveAction)
   {
       var toRemove = new List<int>();
       foreach (var kvp in _registeredHotkeys)
           if (kvp.Value.Action != preserveAction)
           {
               UnregisterHotKey(_windowHandle, kvp.Key);
               toRemove.Add(kvp.Key);
           }
       foreach (var id in toRemove)
           _registeredHotkeys.Remove(id);
   }
   ```

2. **`MainViewModel.cs`** — In `WindowFocusedHotkeys` mode, `ToggleWindow` is now registered globally first (before any other hotkeys), and on window deactivation the app calls `UnregisterAllExcept(HotkeyAction.ToggleWindow)` instead of `UnregisterAllHotkeys()`:

   ```csharp
   // OnMainWindowDeactivated (window-focused mode)
   _hotkeyService.UnregisterAllExcept(HotkeyAction.ToggleWindow);
   ```

   `ToggleWindow` remains registered at the Win32 level for the entire app lifetime, so it fires even when OmenCore is minimised to tray or completely hidden.

### Fix D — `CapabilityWarning` False Positive for PawnIO Users

**Severity:** Low — misleading banner; does not affect functionality

**Symptom:** On systems with Secure Boot enabled but **PawnIO already installed**, the status banner showed: `"Secure Boot enabled - some features may be limited. Install OMEN Gaming Hub for full control."` — despite PawnIO being the exact driver designed for Secure Boot environments. The message recommended installing OGH, which is contrary to OmenCore's purpose.

**Root Cause:** `MainViewModel` capability warning evaluation did not check `PawnIOAvailable`:

```csharp
// Before — fires for every SB-enabled user without OGH, even with PawnIO
else if (capabilities.SecureBootEnabled && !capabilities.OghRunning)
    CapabilityWarning = "Secure Boot enabled - some features may be limited. Install OMEN Gaming Hub for full control.";
```

**Fix:** Added `!capabilities.PawnIOAvailable` guard; updated message text to be accurate:

```csharp
// After — only shown when there is genuinely no driver available
else if (capabilities.SecureBootEnabled && !capabilities.PawnIOAvailable && !capabilities.OghRunning)
    CapabilityWarning = "Secure Boot enabled — WinRing0 is blocked. PawnIO provides compatible driver access for EC/MSR features.";
```

### Fix E — Missing Event Unsubscriptions in `MainViewModel.Dispose()`

**Severity:** Low — potential delegate retention until GC; no functional impact

**Problem:** Five event subscriptions established in the constructor had no corresponding `-=` in `Dispose()`:

- `_fanService.PresetApplied += OnFanPresetApplied` — no unsubscription before `_fanService.Dispose()`
- `_performanceModeService.ModeApplied += OnPerformanceModeApplied` — never unsubscribed
- `_omenKeyService.ToggleOmenCoreRequested += OnOmenKeyToggleWindow` — four OmenKey event handlers unsubscribed only when their *service* was disposed; `OmenKeyService.Dispose()` does not clear its events, so `MainViewModel` method references were retained

**Fix:** Added explicit `-=` for all five handlers in `Dispose()`:
- `_fanService.PresetApplied -= OnFanPresetApplied` and `_performanceModeService.ModeApplied -= OnPerformanceModeApplied` added immediately before `_fanService.Dispose()`
- Four OmenKey handlers unsubscribed in a null-guarded block immediately before `_omenKeyService?.Dispose()`

### Fix F — `_amdGpuService` Field Race Condition

**Severity:** Very low — theoretical data race; would require millisecond-precise thread interleaving at startup

**Problem:** `_amdGpuService` was assigned `null` from a fire-and-forget background `Task.Run` (AMD GPU async init failure path) while the UI thread could simultaneously read the field when lazily constructing `SystemControlViewModel`. Without a memory barrier, the UI thread could observe a stale reference.

**Fix:** Marked the field `volatile`, ensuring all reads and writes go through the memory barrier:

```csharp
// Before
private AmdGpuService? _amdGpuService;

// After
private volatile AmdGpuService? _amdGpuService;
```
