**v2.7.1 Patch Released** 🔧

Quick update with some important fixes:

**Bug Fixes:**
- **Bloatware Manager** - Was completely broken (wouldn't scan or display apps). Now works properly with better protection for essential apps (GPU drivers, Visual C++ runtimes, .NET, etc.)
- **EC Warning Spam** - If you had OGH installed, the EC contention warnings would flood your logs. Now shows once per session
- **OMEN Max 16 (8D41)** - Added to model database for 2025 Max 16 owners with RTX 5080
- **GPU Boost indicator** - Made more visible with glowing badge

**Downloads:** https://github.com/theantipopau/omencore/releases/tag/v2.7.1
