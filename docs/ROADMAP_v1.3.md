- ✅ No OMEN Gaming Hub needed
- ✅ No third-party undervolt tools (ThrottleStop, XTU)
- ✅ No external monitoring apps
- ✅ No separate RGB software for keyboard
- ✅ Fully signed, Windows Defender safe
- ✅ Works on Secure Boot systems via PawnIO

## 🐛 Priority Bug Fixes (v1.2.2)

### Critical

1. **Installer Post-Install Launch Error (Code 740)**
   - **Issue:** First launch after install shows "CreateProcess failed; code 740" (elevation required)
   - **Cause:** Inno Setup Run section doesn't request elevation for post-install launch
   - **Fix:** Add `Verb: runas` to the Run section for elevated launch
   - **Status:** ✅ Fixed in installer

2. **Fan Presets Not Working (Only MAX Works)**
   - **Issue:** Users report only MAX preset affects fans; other presets don't align with curves
   - **Cause:** HP BIOS thermal policy overrides custom fan levels on many models
   - **Investigation Needed:**
     - SetFanLevel WMI command may not be supported on all models
     - SetFanMode sets thermal policy but doesn't allow granular speed control
     - Some models only support Max/Auto, not intermediate levels
   - **Potential Solutions:**
     - Detect thermal policy version and available features
     - Fall back to EC direct access (via PawnIO) for true custom curves
     - Use SetFanTable WMI command if supported (CMD 0x32)
     - Document which models support which features

3. **High CPU Usage / ACPI.sys DPC Spikes**
   - **Issue:** Some users report CPU spikes related to ACPI.sys
   - **Cause:** Frequent WMI queries can trigger ACPI overhead
   - **Solutions:**
     - Reduce polling frequency when app is minimized
     - Implement adaptive polling (less frequent when temps stable)
     - Cache WMI results and only refresh on demand
     - Add "Low Resource Mode" toggle
